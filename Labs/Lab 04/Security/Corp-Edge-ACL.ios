! Permitting traffic at the end will ensure OSPF, HTTP/HTTPs, and FTP traffic will still work 
! OSPF uses an IP multi-cast address of 255.0.0.5
! We are not putting in the 192.168.100.x addresses as they are only used for OSPF Router ID's and are not used for data traffic.
! Those Lo0 addresses are still being recieved by the router from the Corporate network since OSPF uses it's

! Apply the ACL to int g0/0/1 (the interface facing the Corporate network)
