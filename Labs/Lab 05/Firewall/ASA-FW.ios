! This config is for a CISCO ASA 5505 series firewall
! Commands for this device are different compared to others

! This firewall is not routed so ip addresses will need to be on vlan interfaces

! Set on e0/0 to be part of the outside interface
int e0/0
no shut
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan 7

interface vlan 7
ip address 197.197.197.194 255.255.255.248
no shutdown
! Set interface vlan 7 name to 'outside'
! Using 'outside' name sets the security level to 0 automatically
nameif outside

! Set on e0/1 and e0/2 to be part of the inside interfaces
int e0/1
no shut
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan 1

int e0/2
no shut
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan 1

interface vlan 1
ip address 192.168.21.1 255.255.255.0
no shutdown
! Set interface vlan 1 name to 'inside'
! Using 'inside' name sets the security level to 100 automatically
nameif inside

! DHCP (These devices have DHCP)
! Enable DHCP daemon with 'dhcpd'

! Set a range of 32 addresses on the inside interface
dhcpd address 192.168.21.101-192.168.21.110 inside

!Set DHCP dns server
dhcpd dns 8.8.8.8

! Set dhcp lease time to 3600 seconds (1 hour)
dhcpd lease 3600

! Enable the DHCP config on the inside interface
dhcpd enable inside

! Add defualt static route to Wireless Router (WR) (Why route outside?)
route outside 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 192.168.21.11

! Static Route to ip address on int g1/0/3 on Core-SW-1
route inside 192.168.20.0 255.255.255.252 192.168.21.10

! Static route to network 192.168.20.4 (R1 and R2 Network)
route inside 192.168.20.4 255.255.255.252 192.168.20.2




! EVERYTHING BELOW IS WORK IN PROGRESS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

! Route Below does not work
! route outside 192.168.20.0 255.255.255.252 192.168.21.10

! Static NAT for PC 1

! Create a network Object for PC1 named 'obj-PC1'
!object network obj-PC1
! Inside Network Object config mode identify the host (IP address of PC1 192.168.21.101)
!network-object PC1
! Configure static NAT for PC1 with a public IP of 197.197.197.196
! Netmask indicates that this is a one-to-one mapping
static (inside,outside) static 197.197.197.196 192.168.21.101 netmask 255.255.255.255


! NAT and PAT use the pool of public IP addresses that the ASA-FW is connected to
! Public IPs: 
!NetAdd: 197.197.197.192 BroadCast 197.197.197.199 
! Usable Host IP Range: 197.197.197.193 - 197.197.197.198 
! Usable Host IPs after devices and static NAT/PAT: 197.197.197.196-197.197.197.198
global (outside) 1 

! ACLs

! ACL to allow ping from outside to PC1
access-list OUTSIDE-ACCESS-IN extended permit icmp any host 197.197.197.196 echo-reply
access-list OUTSIDE-ACCESS-IN extended permit icmp any host 197.197.197.196 echo

! ACL to allow pings inbound to the outside interface
access-list OUTSIDE-ACCESS-IN extended permit icmp any any echo
access-list OUTSIDE-ACCESS-IN extended permit icmp any any echo-reply
! ACL to allow all traffic inbound to the outside interface
access-group OUTSIDE-ACCESS-IN in interface outside


! Make one for inbouhd traffic to the inside interface
access-list INSIDE-ACCESS-IN extended permit icmp any any echo
access-list INSIDE-ACCESS-IN extended permit icmp any any echo-reply
access-group INSIDE-ACCESS-IN in interface inside



! Apply the ACL to the outside interface in an inbound direction
