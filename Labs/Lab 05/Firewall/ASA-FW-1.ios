! This config is for a CISCO ASA 5505 series firewall (Version 8.2(5))
! Note: When looking at configuration examples online maake sure to look up examples for "pre 8.3" as the commands are different adter version 8.3
! Commands for this device are different compared to others


! Interface configs -------------------------------------------------------------------

! Set on e0/0 to be part of the outside interface
int e0/0
no shut
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan 7

interface vlan 7
ip address 197.197.197.194 255.255.255.248
no shutdown
! Set interface vlan 7 name to 'outside'
! Using 'outside' name sets the security level to 0 automatically
nameif OUTSIDE
security-level 0

! Set on e0/1 and e0/2 to be part of the inside interfaces
int e0/1
no shut
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan 1

int e0/2
no shut
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan 1

interface vlan 1
ip address 192.168.21.1 255.255.255.0
no shutdown
! Set interface vlan 1 name to 'inside'
! Using 'inside' name sets the security level to 100 automatically
nameif INSIDE
security-level 100

! DHCP--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

! DHCP (These devices have DHCP)
! Enable DHCP daemon with 'dhcpd'

! Set a range of 32 addresses on the inside interface
dhcpd address 192.168.21.101-192.168.21.102 inside

!Set DHCP dns server
dhcpd dns 8.8.8.8

! Set dhcp lease time to 3600 seconds (1 hour)
dhcpd lease 3600

! Enable the DHCP config on the inside interface
dhcpd enable inside

! Static Route to ip address on int g1/0/3 on Core-SW-1
route inside 192.168.20.0 255.255.255.252 192.168.21.10

! Static route to network 192.168.20.4 (R1 and R2 Network)
route inside 192.168.20.4 255.255.255.252 192.168.20.2

! Static route to L3-SW-ISP
route outside 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 197.197.197.193 

! Static route to 4.4.4.0 network
! route outside 4.4.4.0 255.255.255.0 197.197.197.193


! Static NAT and PAT

! Static NAT for PC 1 (IP: 192.168.21.101) to an IP Address of 197.197.197.195 (use netmask of /32 since this is a one to one mapping ie. one ip to one ip)
static (INSIDE,OUTSIDE)  197.197.197.195 192.168.21.101 netmask 255.255.255.255

! Dynamic PAT for network
global (OUTSIDE) 1 interface
! Allow inside network to be translated (Allow the 21.0 network to be translated)
nat (INSIDE) 1 192.168.21.0 255.255.255.0
nat (INSIDE) 2 192.168.20.0 255.255.255.0


! This opens up and allows everything (Use the NAT statements above though)
nat (outside) 1 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 outside
global (inside) 1 interface 

! ---------------- Work in Progress ------------------------------------------------------------------------

! ACLs (These were made in clas so they should be right)

! ACE for devices on the outside to access the web server (PC1) 
access-list OUTSIDE-ACL extended permit tcp any host 197.197.197.195 eq www
! ACE for devices on the outside to ping the web server (Not recommended in a production environment but is useful to test connectivity)
access-list OUTSIDE-ACL extended permit icmp any host 197.197.197.195
! Allow ping from 4.4.4.4 to go through the outside interface
access-list OUTSIDE-ACL extended permit icmp any host 4.4.4.4

! Apply the ACL in an inbound direction to the outside interface
access-group OUTSIDE-ACL in interface OUTSIDE

! ACE to Allow inside interfaces to ping devices on the outside
access-list INSIDE-ACL extended permit ip any any

! Apply the ACL in an inbound direction to the inside interface
access-group INSIDE-ACL in interface INSIDE


! -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


! Policy map for ICMP





! This enables the ADSM (Web GUI) on for the inside interface (Not required, I just wanted to try it)
http server enable 
http 192.168.21.0 255.255.255.0 inside


access-list OUTSIDE-ACL extended permit ip host 180.1.2.85 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0
access-group OUTSIDE-ACL in interface outside
